const numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4];

let newNumbers = [];

for(let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
	newNumbers.push(numbers[i] * 10);
}

- We can emulate the exact sequence being performed by the for loop through the use of a mapping function
as follows:

numbers.map(num => num * 10)

- This can create a new array, and as an added bonus does not change the array values of numbers

- In the context of JSX, this can even be applied to create new elements on a page in the following way:

numbers.map(num => <div>{num}</div>)

- This is exactly what we will do for our ImageList component
