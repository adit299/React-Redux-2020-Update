Recall, the following rules about Action Creators:

(1) Action Creators must return action objects

(2) Actions must have a type property

(3) Actions can optionally have a 'payload'


Once we have installed redux thunk, these rules change to the following:

(1) Action creators can return action objects or can return functions

(2) If an action object gets returned, it must have a type

(3) If an action object gets returned, it must have a type

(4) If an action object gets returned, it can optionally have a 'payload'


The first point is the key to what is making redux-thunk possible/suitable to work with as a middleware to 
handle our API calls

- We get returned a function, which we can then at our own leisure, make the API call and continue with our action
creator work flow
