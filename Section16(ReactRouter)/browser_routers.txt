There are three different react routers which we can use:

- Browser Router -> Uses everything after the TLD (.com, .net) or port as the 'path'
  - ex. localhost:3000</pagetwo>

- Hash Router -> Uses everything after a # as the 'path'
  - ex. localhost:3000</#/pagetwo>

- Memory Router -> Doesn't use the URL to track navigation
  - localhost:3000/


- What is the point of the different routers?
	- In reality, using browser router causes some complications in the deployment of the app. Traditional
	HTML servers will look for the /pagetwo route, see that there is none defined, and respond with a 404 error
	- On the other hand, when we make this same request to a create-react-app server, the key takeaway is that
	instead of returning a 404 error, the server responds with our index.html file, which contains bundle.js,
	that encompasses all the code we have written. From there, we can easily identify the /pagetwo route.
