What is React and what is its purpose?

At its core, React is a javascript library. Its ultimate purpose is to handle user interaction on HTML files,
and "react" in some way to these interactions.


Why was there a class in the code? 

This is a JavaScript class, a feature that was added in ES-2015. A React "component" or what React is at its core,
is a small part that can handle user interaction and "react" in some way to this. All React components are
constructed using these classes


What was the HTML looking stuff?

It is actually a special markdown language called JSX. It has the ability to be placed within Javascript code
and allows us to manipulate HTML using React. Think of it as an alternative to using .ejs files


How did the screen change when the mouse move was detected?

What is the difference between React and the React-Dom?

The React library is in charge of knowing what a component is and how to make the components work together, as 
many of our applications will include a substantial amount of components.

The ReactDOM library takes these components and is what is in charge of actually getting the components to display
on the DOM or the HTML.
