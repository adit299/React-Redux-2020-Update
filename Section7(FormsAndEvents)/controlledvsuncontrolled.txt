- Notes on Controlled vs Uncontrolled components:
	- We essentially want our applications to mainly rely on the react code as opposed to the DOM code
	- This is why we refactored our code to aid with this, relying on initialized values in state as opposed to
	the DOM
	- It also makes certain operations easier to implement than traditional HTML DOM manipulation
