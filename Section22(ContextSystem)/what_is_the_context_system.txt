The Props System
	- Gets data from a parent component to a direct child component

Context System
	- Gets data from a parent component to any nested child component


- So, recall that with the props system we can directly pass data to a child only

- The context system allows us to bypass this system, and pass data to more deeply nested components



- There are two ways to get information into the context system
	(1) Using the default value
	(2) Using the Parent Component (provider)
	



- There are two ways to get information out of the context system (sources that use the data)
	(1) this.context
	(2) The Consumer



An Important note about the context system:

- Note that each component that is wrapped with a seperate provider tag consumes its own pipeline of information

- They are mutually exclusive, so each provider tag is its own pipeline of context information


Why Should we use the Consumer method of obtaining state as opposed to this.context?

- The consumer method allows us to easily access values from multiple context objects, as opposed to state, which only
allows us to access values from one context object
