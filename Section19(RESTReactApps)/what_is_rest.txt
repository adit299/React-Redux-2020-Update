REST (stands for Representational State Transfer), is a predefined set of rules that developers should follow
when they follow when they create their API. One of these rules has to do with how you get a pieces of data through
the use of reponses and requests.

REST convention states that the following requests and their responses should look like the following


Name		URL			Verb		Description

Index		/<something>		GET		retrieves all values 

New		/<something>/new	GET		displays form to create new value

Create		/<something>		POST		adds the new <something> to database

Show		/<something>/:id	GET		shows info about one particular object

Edit		/<something>/:id/edit	GET		shows edit form for <something>

Update		/<something>/:id	PUT		update the <something> and redirect elsewhere

Destroy		/<something>/:id	DELETE		delete the <something> and redirect elsewhere	



- See the push vs patch image. A common misconception is that a put request can be used when editing a particular
entry. However, in reality, a major flaw of the put request is that it will completely edit the entry we want
with the values we submitted

- Thus, when we made a huge effort to send only the data pertaining to the edit in our put request, it causes this
error

- So, to solve this, it is better to use a "patch" request, which will edit only the entries that we send in the request
and leave the rest of the entries alone.
