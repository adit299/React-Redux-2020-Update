Programmatic Navigation - When a user is forcibly redirected to another page

Intentional Navigation - When a user is given a choice to navigate to another page


- The predicament we found ourselves in is that after successfully creating a stream, we want to redirect the user
back to the list of streams

- Upon first glance, the solution might seem to be just to simply redirect to the stream list, but how can we verify
that any error didn't occur this way?

- Thus, we have to utilize programmatic navigation, so that the user is redirected only if the stream is successfully
created

- *We haven't added error handling yet*
