- React Hooks allow us to implement "state" within functional based components

- Using hooks we can simulate most of the processes within a class based component, within a functional
based component


- Also, note that just like with the classbased component counterpart, when we have a onClick event handler, whenever, it 
is triggered the app re-renders

- In this re-rendering process, within the useState function call at the top that initializes state, the default value that we
pass in is replaced with the value that is assigned to it from the onClick function
