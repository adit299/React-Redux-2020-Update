- create-react-app comes with a deployment bundle, a static version of our files
which we can deploy to some deployment provider of our choice and have that as 
a host of our content

- Note that we do not need a VM of some kind for our code, because our code does not
contain any server requests, and does not need to execute server code based on user
input

- Within our deployment target, our app would make requests, and depending on the 
requests being made, our deployment target would respond appropriately


Vercel deployment

- sign up at vercel.com

- install the vercel cli
npm install vercel -g

- run vercel in our project directory

- To re-deploy, use the term vercel --prod


Netlify Deployment

- Netlify is also a good deployment option if you want the deployment to be more
reliant on github and git repositories
