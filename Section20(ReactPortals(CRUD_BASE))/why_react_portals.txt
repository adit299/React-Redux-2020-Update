- When we want to flash a message in front of a user (for example, to delete a stream), in the past Adobe flash
was a good tool, but flash is going to be obsolete by the end of the year

- So, we turn our attention to React Portals

- Why React Portals?
	- Creating a flashing message may seem like a trivial task which can be accomplished through the use
	of simple CSS
	- However, creating an overlayed message ontop of existing content, would mean adjusting the Z parameter
	until it is overlayed. However, in an extremely complicated project, which could potentially contain
	100s of nested components, tweaking the Z parameter for one piece of content, just doesn't seem reasonable
	- This is where React Portals comes into play
	- React Portals allow us to sidestep the traditional component hierarchy, and display elements as higher
	up in the component hierarchy, so that we don't have to deal with all this annoying CSS and other 
	component nesting related issues.
